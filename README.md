### What is CalcPy?
It's just a calculator, written in python. Nothing more, nothing less. :/

### Installation

#### Windows
Go to the [release page](), download the executable and run it. As simple as that.


#### Linux
On linux you can run the .exe file with [wine](https://github.com/wine-mirror/wine), a program that allows you to run windows executables on linux.
If you have it installed just navigate to the app directory and type:
```
wine CalcPy.exe
```

In alternative you can download the python file and execute it if you have python installed on your machine. You can do it in two ways:
```
python CalcPy.py
```
or 
```
python3 CalcPy.py
```

or simply use chmod to make the file executable:
```
chmod +x CalcPy.py
```

and then:
```
./CalcPy.py
```

#### Linux package
coming soon...

### Conclusion
Since the executable is not signed, your antivirus will probably block it. If you want you can add an exeption in your antivirus settings or if you don't trust the exe, just download the python file and run it with python.
